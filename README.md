# WIM 1.4.0 - TurtleWoW

## Patch Notes

### New Features
- **New Filter Type: Exact** – Now filters only whispers matching exact. "inv" only blocks message "inv" but still allows "can you make raid inv later"
- **Unfocus WIM Window** – Pressing Escape now removes window focus but keep text intact. This feature is optional and can be enabled under general.
- **Alt+Arrow Key Toggle** – Added option to text cursor moving. Alt modifier now can be disabled to work like in normal inputbox with arrow keys.

### Bug Fixes
- **Ingame Links** – All chat links such as items, spells, quests, etc. now insert correctly without gaps.
- **Macro Whispers** – Script- and macro-based whispers now send and display correctly in the WIM window.
- **Filter Iteration** – Fixed Lua 5.0 table iteration to now properly use `pairs()`, preventing undefined behavior.

### UI Improvements
- Reorganized General options for improved clarity and better accessibility
- Updated code formatting across all checkboxes for consistency
